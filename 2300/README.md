## Transcript

Hey everyone, that's it. You're done. You've completed our Docker Quick Start course. 

However, if you're anything like me, you're already wondering what's next? What am I going to learn that's going to help further my knowledge or my career? Well, unfortunately, only you can answer that question. 

However, I am here to provide a little bit of guidance. 

Let's say you were taking this course and you kept thinking, How are we doing this? You know, how are we creating these containers? Then I'd recommend that you take a step back and take my [Essential Container Concepts](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/250?redirect_uri=https://app.linuxacademy.com/search?query=Essential%20Container%20Concepts) course, which will go over concepts like name spaces, Trudeau environments see groups, the technology that helped make containers a real product. 

But if you already know those concepts or you're just ready to learn more docker, I'd recommend that you go in and take our [Docker Deep Dive](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/314?redirect_uri=https://app.linuxacademy.com/search?query=Docker%20Deep%20Dive) course. This will enable you to learn more about being able to mount volumes into containers or the ability to set up networking. 

Let's say that you're looking for a job right now, and you really want to be able to prove that you know these concepts, then go through and take our [Docker Certified Associates](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/347?redirect_uri=https://app.linuxacademy.com/search?query=Docker%20Certified%20Associates) course and gain the information, gain the knowledge that you need to know to be able to pass that exam before you go applying for a job. 

Let's say, though, that you are a big picture person and you want to understand. How do we do this in a production environment? How do we create these containers that I've been using on a massive scale, you know, hundreds of thousands of them then there are two courses that I'd recommend, the first being that [Docker Certified Associates](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/347?redirect_uri=https://app.linuxacademy.com/search?query=Docker%20Certified%20Associates) course, because it will introduce you to Docker Swarm. 

Or, if you really want to know the nitty gritty, I'd recommend our [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/221?redirect_uri=https://app.linuxacademy.com/search?query=Kubernetes%20the%20Hard%20Way) course. Learn how to build your Kubernetes environment from the ground up to really understand how container orchestration occurs. 

Regardless of what you decide, do me a favor, drop by our containers channel on our community slack, and let me know that you finished this course and what you decided to do. Not a slack person, no problem. Drop by our community message board and let me know how you've decided to continue your journey. 

Until next time, this is El Marquez with linuxacademy.com.
